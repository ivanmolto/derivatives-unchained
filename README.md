# DERIVATIVES UNCHAINED
A fast and enhanced web and mobile web app built with Vue 3 and making use of the Vega GraphQL API via queries and subscriptions.

[Vega](https://vega.xyz) is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on a fully decentralized network.

Built with love for Vega challenge at Encode Club Hack The System.

## Intro
A fresh approach to derivatives trading using Vega's APIs.
Showcasing Markets, Assets, Parties, Statistics and streaming data where possible with recent Trades, and Orders.

## Note
With the reset of the Testnet the weekend of the submission I had to rethink my approach to the challenge. You know "making 80% of the hack in the (last) 20% of the time :)"
Once the reset was finished I have tried to rebuild it. Thanks!
